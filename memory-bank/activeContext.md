2. **Begin Implementation** - Start Phase 1: Repository Setup (Task 1.1)
3. **Validate Environment** - Confirm all development tools working
4. **Initial Commit** - Push Memory Bank and docs to repository

### Phase 1 Implementation Plan
Following the roadmap in `020-roadmap-v1.md`:

#### Week 1: Foundation Setup
- **Task 1.1:** Repository structure & tooling (4-6 hours)
- **Task 1.2:** Next.js web application bootstrap (6-8 hours)  
- **Task 1.3:** Database schema & Prisma setup (4-6 hours)
- **Task 1.4:** Authentication & user management (6-8 hours)

#### Critical Dependencies Needed
- OpenRouter API key configuration (provided: sk-or-v1-96f5ea9d...)
- AWS CLI access validation (configured with SSO)
- GitHub repository permissions (username: pape45)
- PostHog API key setup (provided: phc_JgXKkyrhKXXj1e1D...)

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Monorepo Structure:** Apps/packages/services organization

5. **Human-AI Collaboration:** AI generation with human oversight

### Editorial Decisions Made
1. **Professional Tone:** News site credibility over casual blogging
2. **Developer Focus:** Technical depth with practical examples
3. **Citation First:** Every claim linked to authoritative source
4. **Speed vs Quality:** 4-hour average publication time target
5. **Global Audience:** English content, GDPR compliance

### Operational Decisions Made
1. **Budget Controls:** Hard $50/month AI spending cap
2. **Review Workflow:** Mandatory human approval for sensitive topics
3. **Source Quality:** Prefer official announcements over rumors
