# Product Context

**Created:** September 6, 2025  
**Project:** AI Newsroom (ainewsroom.news)  

## Why This Project Exists

AI Newsroom addresses a critical gap in the AI/ML information landscape. While the field moves rapidly with breakthrough announcements, research papers, and tool releases happening daily, there's no single, authoritative source that:

1. **Aggregates comprehensively** across academic, industry, and community sources
2. **Filters for quality** while maintaining timeliness
3. **Provides developer context** with practical implementation details
4. **Maintains journalistic standards** with proper attribution and fact-checking
5. **Scales human oversight** efficiently without sacrificing editorial quality

## Problems We Solve

### For AI-Curious Developers
- **Information Overload:** Too many sources, newsletters, forums to track
- **Shallow Coverage:** Most news lacks technical depth or practical guidance
